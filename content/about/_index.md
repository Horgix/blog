Alexis "Horgix" Chotard is a french systems and software engineer currently
working at [Xebia](https://xebia.fr/).

# Biography

## The politically correct one

With a software engineering background, and experiences more inclined toward
systems and infrastructure, he naturally finds himself at home around "DevOps"
topics.

Horgix is eager to **automate everything he can** and currently loves working
on various topics such as continuous integration and deployment, or design of
dynamic architectures and applications integration into these. He's happy to
face new challenges with the gain in popularity of containers and to look for
evolutions of traditionnal workflows.

On his spare time, he also maintains a bunch of Arch Linux packages,
contributes to Open Source projects and plays with Cloud Native solutions to be
able to use them in real clients projects.

## The unofficial version

I want to see everything automated, and I can't get myself to accept not clean
things. I want to automate everything, but I want to do it cleanly. No dirty
and unmaintainable shell scripts. No documented processes because "I didn't
take the time to automate this". I want my tools and my infrastructure to do
what I want by themselves so I can sleep at night, answer people questions by
pointing them to API calls and explaining them interesting things. I want to
work on interesting problems such as distributed systems, architecture and
low level performance and integration.
