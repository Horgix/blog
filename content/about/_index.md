# Biography

With a software engineering background, and experiences more inclined toward
systems and infrastructure, he naturally finds himself at home around "DevOps"
topics.
`
Horgix is eager to automate everything he can and currently loves working on
various topics such as continuous integration and deployment, or design of
dynamic architectures and applications integration into these. He's happy to
face new challenges with the gain in popularity of containers and to look for
evolutions of traditionnal workflows.

On his spare time, he also maintains a bunch of ArchLinux packages, contributes
to Open Source projects and plays with Cloud Native solutions to be able to use
rhem in real clients projects.
