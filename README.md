# Blog

This is my blog with random rants :)

## Theme

I'm using the [_"Future Imperfect"_ Hugo
theme](https://github.com/jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect) from [Julio
Pescador](https://github.com/jpescador).

I'm (unfortunately) not using the upstream one, and instead use [my own
fork](https://github.com/Horgix/hugo-future-imperfect) for the following
reasons:

- I wanted to get the sidebar avatar be fetched from
  [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/), and [submitted a Pull Request for
  it](https://github.com/jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect/pull/130) that hasn't
  been merged so far because the author is waiting for a major rework of the
  theme
- I needed my own Layout to display Meetup that are not really article and need
  some custom processing
